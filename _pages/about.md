## Hi, welcome to my page! ##

I'm a doctoral student at the [Automatic Control Laboratory][https://www.epfl.ch/labs/la/] and [Risk Analytics and Optimization Chair][https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rao/] at EPFL, as well as the [Automatic Control Laboratory][https://control.ee.ethz.ch/] at ETH Zürich. I am jointly supervised by Prof. [Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate][https://people.epfl.ch/giancarlo.ferraritrecate], Prof. [Daniel Kuhn][https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn] and Prof. [John Lygeros][https://control.ee.ethz.ch/people/profile.john-lygeros.html]. My research interests lie in the intersection of control theory, stochastic programming and robust optimization, with a key focus on distributionally robust optimal control.

## Biography ##

I received a BSc in Engineering Physics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2021 and a MSc in Mathematics in 2024 from the same institution. My master thesis was on [Deep Q-learning in continuous time][https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1923803&dswid=-163], supervised by Prof. [Boualem Djehiche][boualem]. During my studies, I was a summer researcher at KTH under the supervision of Prof. [Karl H. Johansson][kalle] and at the University of Michigan where I was supervised by Prof. [Necmiye Ozay][necmiye]. I also had an exchange semester at ETH Zürich.
