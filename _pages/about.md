## Biography ##

I was born in Sweden. I received a BSc in Engineering Physics and is currently completing a MSc in Mathematics both from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, graduating in June 2024. During my studies I have completed two research internships: one at KTH under supervision of Prof. [Karl H. Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/) and one at the University of Michigan supervised by Prof. Necmiye Ozay, which led to two [publications](/publications/).
