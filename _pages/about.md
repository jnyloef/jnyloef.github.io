## Hi, welcome to my page! ##

I'm a master student in mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My research interests lie in the intersection of control theory, optimization, reinforcement learning and stochastic control. I also have an interest in physics, in particular quantum computing.

In my free time, I play electric guitar and really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing.

**Currently looking for a PhD position** - Feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to provide any additional information.

## biography ##

I was born in Sweden. I received a BSc in Engineering Physics from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology][https://www.kth.se/en] in Stockholm, Sweden and I am currently completing a MSc in Mathematics from the same institution, graduating in June 2024. My master thesis is about Q-learning in continuous time, supervised by Prof. [Boualem Djehiche][boualem]. During my studies I have completed two research internships: one at KTH under supervision of Prof. [Karl H. Johansson][kalle] and one at the University of Michigan supervised by Prof. [Necmiye Ozay][necmiye], which each led to [publications][publications]. I have also completed an exchange semester at ETH ZÃ¼rich while studying physics, where my courses were centered around quantum computation.
